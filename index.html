                    <p>Our primary goal is to secure and protect our website for you and for us in the best possible
                        way. To ensure this, we
                        use Google reCAPTCHA from Google Inc. For the European region, Google Ireland Limited (Gordon
                        House, Barrow Street
                        Dublin 4, Ireland) is responsible for all Google services. With reCAPTCHA we can determine
                        whether you really are a
                        flesh and blood person and not a robot or other spam software. We understand spam to mean any
                        electronically undesirable
                        information that we receive without being asked. With the classic CAPTCHAS you mostly had to
                        solve text or picture
                        puzzles to check. With reCAPTCHA from Google, we usually don't have to bother you with such
                        puzzles. In most cases, it
                        is sufficient to simply tick the box and confirm that you are not a bot. With the new Invisible
                        reCAPTCHA version you
                        don't even have to check the box anymore. You can find out exactly how this works and, above
                        all, what data is used for
                        this in the course of this data protection declaration.</p>
                    <p><strong>What is reCAPTCHA?</strong></p>
                    <p>reCAPTCHA is a free captcha service from Google that protects websites from spam software and
                        misuse by non-human
                        visitors. The most common use of this service is when filling out forms on the Internet. A
                        captcha service is a type of
                        automatic turing test that is designed to ensure that an action on the Internet is performed by
                        a human being and not a
                        bot. In the classic Turing test (named after computer scientist Alan Turing), a person
                        ascertains the distinction
                        between bot and person. At Captchas, this is also done by the computer or a software program.
                        Classic captchas work with
                        small tasks that are easy for humans to solve, but are very difficult for machines. With
                        reCAPTCHA, you no longer have
                        to actively solve puzzles. The tool uses modern risk techniques to distinguish people from bots.
                        Here you only have to
                        tick the text field "I am not a robot" or with Invisible reCAPTCHA even this is no longer
                        necessary. At reCAPTCHA, a
                        JavaScript element is integrated into the source text and then the tool runs in the background
                        and analyzes your user
                        behavior. The software calculates a so-called captcha score from these user actions. Google uses
                        this score to calculate
                        the likelihood that you are human before entering the captcha. reCAPTCHA or Captchas in general
                        are always used when
                        bots could manipulate or abuse certain actions (e.g. registrations, surveys, etc.).</p>
                    <p><strong>Why do we use reCAPTCHA on our website?</strong></p>
                    <p>We only want to welcome flesh-and-blood people on our side. Bots or spam software of all kinds
                        can safely stay at home.
                        That is why we are doing everything possible to protect ourselves and offer you the best
                        possible user friendliness. For
                        this reason, we use Google reCAPTCHA from Google. So we can be pretty sure that we will remain a
                        "bot-free" website. By
                        using reCAPTCHA, data is transmitted to Google to determine whether you are really human.
                        reCAPTCHA thus serves the
                        security of our website and subsequently also your security. For example, without reCAPTCHA it
                        could happen that a bot
                        registers as many e-mail addresses as possible when registering, in order to subsequently "spam"
                        forums or blogs with
                        unwanted advertising content. With reCAPTCHA we can avoid such bot attacks.</p>
                    <p><strong>What data does reCAPTCHA store?</strong></p>
                    <p>reCAPTCHA collects personal data from users to determine whether the actions on our website
                        really come from people. So
                        the IP address and other data that Google needs for the reCAPTCHA service can be sent to Google.
                        Within the member
                        states of the EU or other contracting states of the Agreement on the European Economic Area, IP
                        addresses are almost
                        always shortened before the data ends up on a server in the USA. The IP address will not be
                        combined with other Google
                        data unless you are logged in with your Google account while using reCAPTCHA. First, the
                        reCAPTCHA algorithm checks
                        whether Google cookies from other Google services (YouTube, Gmail, etc.) have already been
                        placed on your browser. Then
                        reCAPTCHA sets an additional cookie in your browser and takes a snapshot of your browser window.
                        The following list of collected browser and user data is not exhaustive. Rather, they are
                        examples of data that we
                        understand to be processed by Google.

                        the Invisible reCAPTCHA version, there is even no ticking and the entire recognition process
                        runs in the background. How
                        much and what data Google stores exactly cannot be learned from Google in detail.</p>

                    <p><strong>How long and where is the data stored?</strong></p>
                    <p>By inserting reCAPTCHA, data is transferred from you to the Google server. Where exactly this
                        data is stored, Google
                        does not clearly state, even after repeated inquiries. Without having received a confirmation
                        from Google, it can be
                        assumed that data such as mouse interaction, time spent on the website or language settings on
                        the European or American
                        Google Servers. The IP address that your browser transmits to Google is generally not merged
                        with other Google data from
                        other Google services. However, if you are logged into your Google account while using the
                        reCAPTCHA plug-in, the data
                        will be merged. The different data protection regulations of the company Google apply.</p>
                    <p><strong>How can I delete my data or prevent data storage?</strong></p>
                    <p>If you want no data about you and your behavior to be transmitted to Google, you must log out of
                        Google completely
                        and
                        delete all Google cookies before visiting our website or using the reCAPTCHA software.
                        Basically, the data is
                        automatically transmitted to Google as soon as you visit our website. To delete this data, you
                        must contact Google
                        support at https://support.google.com/?hl=de&tid=311201005.

                        Google

                    <p><strong>Why do we use Google Fonts on our website?</strong></p>
                    <p>With Google Fonts we can use fonts on our own website, but they don't have to be uploaded to our
                        own
                        server. Google
                        Fonts is an important building block to keep the quality of our website high. All Google fonts
                        are
                        automatically
                        optimized for the web and this saves data volume and is a great advantage especially for use
                        with
                        mobile
                        devices. When
                        you visit our site, the small file size ensures a fast loading time. Furthermore, Google Fonts
                        are
                        secure web fonts.
                        Different image synthesis systems (rendering) in different browsers, operating systems and
                        mobile
                        devices can lead to
                        errors. Such errors can partially distort texts or entire websites. Thanks to the fast content
                        delivery
                        network (CDN),
                        there are no cross-platform problems with Google Fonts. Google Fonts supports all common
                        browsers
                        (Google Chrome,
                        Mozilla Firefox, Apple Safari, Opera) and works reliably on most modern mobile operating
                        systems,
                        including Android 2.2+
                        and iOS 4.2+ (iPhone, iPad, iPod). We use Google Fonts so that we can present our entire online
                        service
                        as nicely and
                        consistently as possible.</p>
                    <p><strong>What data does Google store?</strong></p>
                    <p>When you visit our website, the fonts are downloaded via a Google server. This external call
                        transfers
                        data to the
                        Google server. In this way, Google also recognizes that you or your IP address are visiting our
                        website.
                        The Google
                        Fonts API was developed to reduce the use, storage and collection of end user data to what is
                        necessary
                        for the proper
                        provision of fonts. By the way, API stands for "Application Programming Interface" and serves,
                        among
                        other things, as a
                        data transmitter in the software area.</p>
                    <p>Google Fonts stores CSS and font requests securely with Google and is therefore protected. The
                        usage
                        figures collected
                        allow Google to determine how well the individual fonts are received. Google publishes the
                        results
                        on
                        internal analysis
                        sites, such as Google Analytics. Google also uses data from its own web crawler to determine
                        which
                        websites use Google
                        fonts. This data is published in the Google Fonts BigQuery database. Entrepreneurs and
                        developers
                        use
                        the Google web
                        service BigQuery to examine and move large amounts of data.</p>
                    <p>However, it should also be borne in mind that with every Google Font request, information such as
                        language settings, IP
                        address, version of the browser, screen resolution of the browser and name of the browser are
                        automatically transferred
                        to the Google server. Whether this data is also stored is not clearly ascertainable or is not
                        clearly
                        communicated by
                        Google.</p>
                    <p><strong>How long and where is the data stored?</strong></p>
                    <p>The data that Google stores for a day or a year cannot simply be deleted. The data is
                        automatically
                        transmitted to
                        Google when the page is accessed. To be able to delete this data prematurely, you must contact
                        Google
                        Support at
                        https://support.google.com/?hl=de&tid=311200266. In this case, you only prevent data storage if
                        you
                        do
                        not visit our
                        website.</p>
                    <p>Unlike other web fonts, Google allows us unlimited access to all fonts. So we can have unlimited
                        access
                        to a sea of
                        fonts and get the most out of our website. You can find more about Google Fonts and other

                        https://developers.google.com/fonts/faq?tid=311200266. Although Google deals with data
                        protection-related matters there,
                        it does not contain any really detailed information about data storage. It is relatively
                        difficult
                        to
                        get really precise
                        information about stored data from Google.</p>

                    <p><strong>Google Fonts Local Privacy Policy</strong></p>
                    <p>We use Google Fonts from Google Inc. on our website. Google Ireland Limited (Gordon House, Barrow
                        Street
                        Dublin 4,
                        Ireland) is responsible for the European region. We have the Google fonts locally, i.e. on our
                        web
                        server - not on
                        Google's servers. This means that there is no connection to Google servers and therefore no data
                        transmission or
                        storage.</p>
                    <p><strong>What are Google fonts?</strong></p>
                    <p>In the past, Google Fonts were also called Google Web Fonts. It is an interactive directory with
                        over
                        800
                        fonts that
                        Google provides for free. With Google Fonts you could use fonts without uploading them to your
                        own
                        server. However, in
                        order to prevent any information transfer to Google servers, we downloaded the fonts to our
                        server.
                        In
                        this way, we act
                        in compliance with data protection and do not send any data to Google Fonts.</p>
                    <p>Unlike other web fonts, Google allows us unlimited access to all fonts. So we can have unlimited
                        access
                        to a sea of
                        fonts and get the most out of our website. You can find more about Google Fonts and other

                    <p>In order to be able to deliver all of our individual websites (sub-pages of our website) to you
                        quickly
                        and securely on
                        all devices, we use the Content Delivery Network (CDN) BootstrapCDN of the American software
                        company
                        StackPath, LLC 2012
                        McKinney Ave. Suite 1100, Dallas, TX 75201, USA.</p>
                    <p>A content delivery network (CDN) is a network of regionally distributed servers that are
                        connected to
                        one
                        another via
                        the Internet. Through this network, content, especially very large files, can be delivered
                        quickly,
                        even
                        with large load
                        peaks.</p>
                    <p>BootstrapCDN works in such a way that so-called JavaScript libraries are delivered to your
                        browser.
                        If
                        your browser
                        downloads a file from BootstrapCDN, your IP address will be transmitted to StockPath during the
                        connection to the
                        Bootstrap CDN server.</p>
                    <p>StackPath also mentions in its in-house privacy policy that the company uses aggregated and
                        anonymized
                        data from various
                        services (such as BootstrapCDN) to extend the backup and for other StackPath services and
                        clients.
                        However, no one can
                        identify all of this data.

                    <p>If you want to prevent this data transmission, you can install a JavaScript blocker (see e.g.
